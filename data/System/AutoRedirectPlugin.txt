---++ Description

This plugin lets you redirect certain URLs in an automatic fashion. A redirect is performed based on a list
of rules that are executed in the given order, taking actions when matching all preconditions.
Redirects can be performed for a single topic, all of a web, for specific users in a given context, or for an
action for all topics and users.

This solition is specifically useful when some of your URLs have changed and you like to redirect users to the new
location. Another important use case for public sites is to hide %SYSTEMWEB%, the Applications and all of its subwebs
for unauthenticated users visiting the site. As your site will host a substantial amount of documentation available
otherwise on the net, you may want to hide it from crawlers redirecting them elsewhere.

In general, it is always preferable to restrict view access using Foswiki's access control. However, sometimes this won't
work out as you still need users to access content such as wiki applications using =%INCLUDE= or via view templates while
blocking direct access to these wiki applications to everybody, except people of a application development group.

---++ Examples

Let's have a look at the following example configuration stored in =$Foswiki::cfg{AutoRedirectPlugin}{Rules}=:

<verbatim class="perl">
[
  {
    "context" => "view",
    "web" => "Sandbox",
    "topic" => "AutoRedirectTest",
    "target" => "Main.WebHome",
  },
  {
    "wikiName" => "WikiGuest",
    "web" => "Applications.*",
    "target" => "Main.WebHome",
  },
  {
    "web" => "System",
    "topic" => 'UserRegistration|ResetPassword|ChangeEmailAddress|ChangePassword',
    "target" => "none",
  },
  {
    "web" => "System",
    "wikiName" => "WikiGuest",
    "target" => "Main.WebHome",
  },
]
</verbatim>

The first rule in this list will redirect anybody visiting <nop>Sandbox.AutoRedorecTest to <nop>Main.WebHome. Note the use of the =view= context to still be able to access this topic
via =edit=.

The second rule hides any unauthenticated (!WikiGuest) user from visiting the Application web and all of its subwebs. This does not depend on any context being set thus fully blocking
access to this part of your wiki. Once the user authenticated will he be able to access the Apllication webs.

Similarly to the second rule the third and fourth rule block unauthenticated access to the System web, with the exception of those parts of the System web that are required for
people to register, reset their password or perform any of these type of actions. Note the special target =none= in the third rule that implements the nessary exception to
the rest of the System web being blocked from access in the fourth rule.

To summarize, each rule in the list may have the following properties:

   * =target=: either a topic to redirect to, or a fully quallified URL
   * =context=: a context identifier; most useful ones are: =view=, =edit=, =save=, =isadmin=, =authenticated=; see [[%SYSTEMWEB%.IfStatements]] for more
   * =wikiName=: regular expression to check the !WikiName of the current user
   * =web=, =topic=: regular expressions to check the current location

All properties are optional except =target= as otherwise the system won't know where to redirect to.
